README - CS349 Assignment 3

Erasing:
	Erasing a single line segment of an object erases the whole object

Slider:
	To insert space into the slider, hold the ctrl key and drag the slider to the right.
	The amount of space inserted is equal to the amount of space traversed during the sliding.
	Sliding to the left has no effect on the frames.
	
Animations:
	Erasing an object in the middle of a set of animation frames causes it to dissappear for that frame as well as all subsequent ones.
	If a set of animation frames have been defined and the slider is dragged to the left and a new animation is recorded, the animation of other objects are played (similar to the plane example in KSketch)
	
Enhancement:
	Copy/Pasting selections
	By using CTRL+C, the current selection is copied onto your clipboard
	CTRL+V pastes a copy of your selection onto the drawing area where your mouse is currently located
	Multiple entities can be copied and pasted at a time.
	Copies will override the previous copy stored in your clipboard
