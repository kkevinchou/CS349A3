Slider:
	To insert space into the slider, hold the ctrl key and drag the slider to the right.
	
Animations:
	Erasing an object in the middle of a set of animation frames causes it to dissappear for that frame as well as all subsequent oens.
	If a set of animation frames have been defined and the slider is dragged to the left and a new animation is recorded, the animation of other objects are played (similar to the plane example in KSketch)
	
	

Enhancement:
	None
